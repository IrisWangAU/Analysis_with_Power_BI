## üî¨ Project Overview 

In 2017, KAT Insurance marked a significant achievement by exceeding a total sales figure of 40 million. To offer a comprehensive perspective of the company's financial health, the project analyzed these sales numbers in greater detail, categorizing them by region, state and insurance type. Alongside total sales, this report also delves into the company's profitability and financial ratios (Contribution Margin Ratio), thereby providing a holistic overview of the business's financial wellbeing.

Furthermore, the project also provided an analysis of the key influences for KAT's Contribution Margin and Contribution Margin Ratio to further reveal the sales performance.

### üíæ Dataset

The original dataset comprises 64,544 insurance policy sales records from 2017, spanning 6 regions, 49 states within the USA, and includes five types of insurance: Professional, Auto, Home, Disability, and Life.  In response to these queries, the total sales is classified by region, state and insurance type, thereafter delving into their patterns and rankings for insights. The primary data is saved in an Excel file, including 2 tables.

The `2017sales` table have the following features:

<br>

#### **`grocery_sales`**
- `"Invoice No"` - an unique Invoice Number for the sale
- `"Date of Sale"` - date of the sale
- `"Month of Sale"` - the month number of the year
- `"Region"` - the Region of the insurance policy sale
- `"State"` - the State of the insurance policy sale
- `"Salesperson"` - the Salesperson of the insurance policy sale
- `"Insurance Type"` - the Insurance type of the insurance policy sale
- `"State Type"` - combination of the state and the insurance type of the sale

The `extra_data.parquet` file contains complementary data:

#### **`extra_data.parquet`**
- `"IsHoliday"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.
- `"Temperature"` - Temperature on the day of sale
- `"Fuel_Price"` - Cost of fuel in the region
- `"CPI"` ‚Äì Prevailing consumer price index
- `"Unemployment"` - The prevailing unemployment rate
- `"MarkDown1"`, `"MarkDown2"`, `"MarkDown3"`, `"MarkDown4"` - number of promotional markdowns
- `"Dept"` - Department Number in each store
- `"Size"` - size of the store
- `"Type"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)

The two files need to be merged and manipulated. The transformed DataFrame can then be stored as the `clean_data` variable containing the following columns:
- `"Store_ID"`
- `"Month"`
- `"Dept"`
- `"IsHoliday"`
- `"Weekly_Sales"`
- `"CPI"`
- `"Unemployment"`

After merging and cleaning the data, the monthly sales of Walmart are stored  as the `agg_data` variable that look like:

|  Month | Weekly_Sales  | 
|---|---|
| 01  |  33174.178494 |
|  02 |  34333.326579 |
|  ... | ...  |  

Finally, the `clean_data` and `agg_data` files are stored as csv files.

### üéØ Project Goals

- Load data from Parquet and CSV files into DataFrame.
- Transform the data into the desired clean format.
- Calculate the average weekly sales by month.
- Save the cleaned data into a CSV file.
- Validate the existence of the final cleaned data in the CSV file.
- Create a data visualization in Power BI.

## üïµÔ∏è Key Insights

- üí∏ **Total Sales by Month**
  - The total E-commerce revenue for Walmart across all files amounts to 3.63 billion.
  - Among all the months, Walmart has the highest revenue in April (0.35 billion), followed by July (0.34 billion) and December (0.33 billion). January has the lowest revenue, at 0.17 billion
 
- üåç **Average Weekly Sales by Month**
  - The average weekly sales are significantly impacted by holidays such as the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
  - In December, Walmart experiences the highest weekly sales (over 38K), followed by November (over 36K).
  > This trend can be attributed to increased consumer purchasing at Walmart in preparation for Christmas.

## üî¨ Project Overview 

In 2017, KAT Insurance marked a significant achievement by exceeding a total sales figure of 40 million. To offer a comprehensive perspective of the company's financial health, the project analyzed these sales numbers in greater detail, categorizing them by region, state and insurance type. Alongside total sales, this report also delves into the company's profitability and financial ratios (Contribution Margin Ratio), thereby providing a holistic overview of the business's financial wellbeing.

Furthermore, the project also provided an analysis of the key influences for KAT's Contribution Margin and Contribution Margin Ratio to further reveal the sales performance.

### üíæ Dataset

The original dataset comprises 64,544 insurance policy sales records from 2017, spanning 6 regions, 49 states within the USA, and includes five types of insurance: Professional, Auto, Home, Disability, and Life.  In response to these queries, the total sales is classified by region, state and insurance type, thereafter delving into their patterns and rankings for insights. The primary data is saved in an Excel file, including 2 tables.

The `2017sales` table have the following features:

<br>

#### **`2017sales`**
- `"Invoice No"` - an unique Invoice Number for the sale
- `"Date of Sale"` - date of the sale
- `"Month of Sale"` - the month number of the year
- `"Region"` - the Region of the insurance policy sale
- `"State"` - the State of the insurance policy sale
- `"Salesperson"` - the Salesperson of the insurance policy sale
- `"Insurance Type"` - the Insurance type of the insurance policy sale
- `"State Type"` - combination of the state and the insurance type of the sale

The `VariableCostPct` table contains variable cost percentage figures for each combination of state and insurance type:

#### **`VariableCostPct`**
- `"State Type"` - combination of the state and the insurance type
- `"Variable Cost Percent"` - the variable cost percentage for each state and insurance type


The two tables are merged and manipulated. The transformed Dataset are stored as the `SalesMerged` table containing the following columns:
- `"Invoice No"` 
- `"Date of Sale"` 
- `"Month of Sale"` 
- `"Region"` 
- `"State"` 
- `"Salesperson"` 
- `"Insurance Type"` 
- `"State Type"`
- `"Variable Cost Percent"`
- `"Variable Cost"`
- `"Contribution Margin"`
- `"Contribution Margin Ratio"`

### üéØ Project Goals

- analyse the total sales, profit and cost in 2017 by region, state and Insurance type to provide insights for revenue distribution
- analysis for the key influencers for contribution margin and contribution margin ratio to provide insghts for financial performance

  - 
 
- üïµÔ∏è **Contribution Margin (CM) and Contribution Margin Ratio (CMR)**
  > The Contribution Margin shows the profit of sale by excluding variable cost from the revenu (Contribution Margin = Sales - Sales * Variable Cost Percent)
  > The Contribution Margin Ratio shows the ability of the sale to convert investment to profit (CMR = CM / Sales)
  - In 2017, the average CMR for each region and month is quite similar around 0.73, which indicates a healthy finance in terms of regions. The Northeast makes the most profit of 8.7 million.
  - when looking at Insurance type, things are getting more interesting. Previously, we have Life Insurance making the least revuene during the year. However, it has reached the highest CMR of 0.89, showing that it is the most profitable insurance policy for KAT. Similarly, although Auto Insurance has reached the 2nd place in total sales, its low CMR of 0.52 indicating that only 52% of the sales are converted into profit.
